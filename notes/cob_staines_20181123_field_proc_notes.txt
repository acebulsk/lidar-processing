GPS PPP correction (Dong, 11/23/18)
	open "Infinity" -- Leica proprietary software
		import Leica GPS data (based on time and size. 2nd file typically, larger)
		export as RINEX (want .18o file, big file)
	Correct GPS data (precice point positioning)
		CSRS-PPP (https://webapp.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/geod/tools-outils/ppp.php?locale=en) (google nrcan)
		Options: Static, ITRF
		correct GPS surevey point data in infinity

M600 data importing and processing notes:
	Flight path processing (POSPac)
		open PosPac, new default project
		double-click on Mission (left pannel)
			change name to date
		save project  (ex. 10Oct)

		import RINEX (.18o)
			import based data(07/Base)
			correct Northing/Easting
			
		for each trajectory
			ignore 1st data file in series (ground test)
			input trajectory data off UAV (09 (or whichever sensor)/02/02/INS-GPS_1)
				omit "unknown" and "base data" files
				rover antenna type -- Antcom G5ANT2AT1
			coordinate manager (right click on base station child)
				correct coordinates (lat/lons and elevation from PPP)
				apply changes, close
			right click base station -- "set base station" -- ok
			project settings
				GNSS -> lever-arm mounting angle -> standard deviation -> 0.030 (lowered for antenna correction)
			GNSS-Inertial Processer
				make sure GNSS Mode: In-Fusion Single Base, wl base station assigned
			Save project

			Manually transport trjectory files to lidar data folders from PosProc project folder (Docs/POSPac UAV/xxx/yyy/yyy/Proc) to (09/Scanner/project/05_INS_GPS_PROC/01)
				sbet
				pinkaru
				smrmsg

	Lidar processing in RiProcess
		open riprocess project in "scanner" folder
			take note of projection (want WGS84 ex. NAD83/Geocentric)	
		[Double-click trajectory
			select sbet file
		Trajectories -> add
			import sbet file (correct to current date)]
		Remove records which are outside trajectory time frame
		Records -> add all flights (exclude ground test) (??? what does this mean?)
		
		Assign devices to all (only for camera data wizard)
			ensure trajectories correspond to correct records
		(repeat above for all paths within project area as desired, then use Project Merge Wizard)
		Data processing wizard
			Tasks 2, 3, & 4 
			check "remove existing tesks..."
		RiPrecision -> adjust all
			processing shows up under "tasks & servers"
		(camera data wizard, if needed... but better to use pixl4d)

		add views (click and drag to add scans, trajectories, etc.)
		export point cloud data
			prop(?) WGS84 UTM Northzone 14
		EXPORT POINT CLOUD (RIGHT CLICK RECORDS)
		coordinate system: WGS84 (always) (on export)

		If we want to merge multile flights -> project merge wizard		

processing tools:
OSGeo4W Shell (shell program for geo tools like PDAL)
PDAL (pdal.io, command line/SHELL) (useful for transfroming  coordinate system (ex. UTM xxx) take note of EPSG code)
	look through online tutorials for tanslation/reprojection
LAStool (command line interface, can use in arcGIS/QGIS) (has limitations with big files in free version)

lidR (R package) (more control of functions, struggles with large files)


NAD83 (Riprocess default)
WGS84 (GWF)
